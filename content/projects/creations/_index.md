Hello, world!

Here are a few samples (of many) scripting/coding projects I have undertaken for fun and amusement:

- Migration from precarious internally-developed custom Python framework to [Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org/).
- Various Java EE apps and things
- Google App Engine
- Android app development
- Python Barcode UPC/EAN/Inventory management class file
- Various associated Python scripts for managing timecards, inventory, mileage logs, and UPC database
- Recompiling [ab2vcard](http://scottstuff.net/ab2vcard/) for Intel-64 archetecture
