I'm a Senior-level Software Engineer. I create art, be it through code, performance, or other. I'm currently working as my own General Contractor to rebuild my house after the Marshall Fire. I a currently available for part-time or contract work and I will be available for full time employment at the end of 2024 when the house is complete. I'm open to opportunities to make the world better.
